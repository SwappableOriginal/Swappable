        <h3>7. Prohibition of Illegal Activities</h3>
        <p>Swappable does not encourage or condone the swapping of illegal objects and/or substances. If users are caught facilitating such swaps, they will be held accountable and can be prosecuted by law. Users found engaging in illegal activities will face immediate suspension and legal consequences.</p>

        <h3>8. Changes to Terms</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Users will be notified of significant changes.</p>
